/*
 * STACK
 * 
 * Definition:
 * A Stack is a linear data structure that follows the LIFO principle
 * (Last In, First Out). The last element added is the first one to be removed.
 * 
 * Key Characteristics:
 * - Elements are added and removed from the same end (called the TOP)
 * - Only the top element is accessible at any time
 * - All operations happen at O(1) time complexity
 * 
 * Basic Operations:
 * 1. PUSH: Add an element to the top of the stack
 * 2. POP: Remove the top element from the stack
 * 3. PEEK/TOP: View the top element without removing it
 * 4. isEmpty(): Check if the stack is empty
 * 5. Size: Get the number of elements in the stack
 * 
 * Real-World Examples:
 * - Browser back button (navigation history)
 * - Undo/Redo functionality
 * - Function call stack in programs
 * - Expression evaluation and parsing
 * - Backtracking algorithms
 * 
 * Time Complexity:
 * Push:   O(1)
 * Pop:    O(1)
 * Peek:   O(1)
 * Search: O(n)
 * 
 * Space Complexity: O(n) where n is the number of elements
